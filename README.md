# stealthGame

A stealth game based on "ninja convention" by dude4k on kongregate.

2 players must attempt to assassinate each other. The catch? Every character on the screen looks identical. Use whatever means necessary to identify your opponent while trying not to give away your own position.

### Screenshot:

_Built using the Phaser framework. See https://phaser.io for more info_
